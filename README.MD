# Google Career Certificate Cyclistic Case Study
This repo stores all files related to my completion of the Google Career Certificate
Case Study. This analysis was completed using R and Google Sheets.

This is a hypothetical business intelligence analysis case study to analyze a bycicle ridesharing company's historic trip data.

## Credits
This project is based on the case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polishedâ€™: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman ([found here](https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study)).

## Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to learn more about Cyclistic's existing customer base in order to develop a marketing strategy to attract casual riders to become annual members - annual memberships are more profitable for Cyclistic.

To develop recommendations for the new marketing campaign, the executive team would like to know:

* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

This project uses trip data to answer the first question in order to influence choices made to address questions 2 and 3.
